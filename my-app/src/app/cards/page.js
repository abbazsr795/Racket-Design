            <p className="text-slate-600">USS Gyatt (DD-712/DDG-1/DDG-712) was a Gearing-class destroyer in service with the United States Navy. The ship was named for Edward Earl Gyatt, a United States Marine Corps private and Marine Raider who was killed during the Battle of Guadalcanal.[1] Laid down in 1944,[2] the destroyer was commissioned in 1945 and missed combat during the Second World War. In 1955, she was converted into a guided missile destroyer (DDG) and served to test onboard missile systems before she was decommissioned and sunk as a target in 1970.</p>
